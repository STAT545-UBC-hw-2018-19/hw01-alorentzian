# About Amanda

This repo is an introduction to myself as part of a homework assignment for [Stat545](http://stat545.com/)

## Why am I taking this course?
I have absolutely no programming experience, so that is one main reason I'm taking the course. Why I think I need to know R:
1. I work with large data sets that I'm currently having a difficult time analyzing myself
2. I like the versatility of the graphing features
3. My supervisor  **loves** R. 

## My life before this course

I moved here from sunny San Diego 1 year ago

Being from southern california, of course I love going to the beach and any water activities :sunny:. But I also love to ski and hike and we don't have much of that down there.  

Pros of San Diego | Pros of Vancouver
----------------- | -----------------
Sunny all the time | Great skiing
Chill vibe | Friendly people
Family and Friends | New friends

I'm looking forward to a *great* few years here in Vancouver
